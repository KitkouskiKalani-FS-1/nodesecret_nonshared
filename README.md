# How to get project to work
You will need to add a .env file to the project when you clone the repo<br /><br />
Once you have created this file add a variable in it called NODE_ENV and set it equal to "mySecretKey" for access to be granted<br /><br />
If the NODE_ENV is set to anything else you will get access denied.
